## How to use

First, you need to setup [Shap-E](https://github.com/openai/shap-e) servers using [demo_Shap-E](https://github.com/astnohk/demo_Shap-E).
Strongly recommended to use Ubuntu or WSL2 to run demo_Shap-E server.
If you run the server on different machine then you need to change the URL specified in `Summoner.gd`.

Then run on the `Godot Editor` or run exported program will display simple window and a 3D mesh will spawn at center of the window.
